Users can now choose how many items appear in charts and tables and what to do with the rest (group as Other, hide them or list them in the table). Users will no longer be restricted to only seeing the default 5 items in charts.

Refer to the <a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/product/seller\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">related documentation</a> for best practices when designing this template. If a Seller product template is not available, merchants will be prompted to create one; otherwise, the default template will be used as a fallback.</p>\n<h3>Cart</h3>\n<p>To enhance your theme's compatibility with apps that utilize <a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/api/functions/latest#input\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">Shopify Function inputs</a> for cart-related functionality, we recommend visually distinguishing remote products from regular products in the cart. Remote products are not included in Shopify Function inputs, and Shopify Function operations cannot target them. Consequently, apps using Shopify Functions for features like cart validation and discounts will not consider remote products in their calculations. This may lead to discrepancies between the cart totals and the calculations returned by these apps.</p>\n<p>For example, if an app calculates free shipping for totals above $50, and a customer has $55 worth of merchandise in their cart, with $20 from a remote product, the Functions will only recognize $35 worth of merchandise. As a result, the customer will see that the free shipping threshold has not been met.</p>\n<p>To identify and visually group remote products in the cart, use the <a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/objects/remote_details\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">remote_details</a> on the product:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-liquid\">&lt;h2&gt;Sold by {{ shop.name }}&lt;/h2&gt;\n{% for item in cart.items %}\n  {% unless item.product.remote_details %}\n    &lt;!-- Items without remote details --&gt;\n  {% endunless %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Sold by other stores&lt;/h2&gt;\n{% for item in cart.items %}\n  {% if item.product.remote_details %}\n    &lt;!-- Items with remote details --&gt;\n  {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Related Documentation</h2>\n<p>Refer to the following documentation for additional information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/objects/remote_product\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">Liquid <code>remote_product</code> object</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/product/seller\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">Seller product template</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/cart#remote-products\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">Remote products in cart</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/collection#remote-products\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">Remote products in collections</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/search#remote-products\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">Remote products in search</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart#json-of-a-cart-with-remote-products\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">Cart AJAX API - example of a cart with remote products</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div> "

We have refreshed the descriptions of all dispute statuses to better reflect real-world outcomes and processor terminology.</p>\n<h2>Who This Is For</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>App developers and partners who read, store, or display dispute statuses.</li>\n<li>Payment and operations tools that report on dispute outcomes.</li>\n<li>Agencies building custom workflows around dispute lifecycle events.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why It Matters</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Distinguish cases where a chargeback was stopped upstream (e.g., via Visa Rapid Dispute Resolution) from other outcomes.</li>\n<li>Update your UI and reporting to reflect that merchants won’t incur a chargeback fee for prevented disputes.</li>\n<li>Gain clearer, more actionable status definitions across the dispute lifecycle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>Processors may send a <code>prevented</code> status when a chargeback is stopped before it’s filed. Currently, Stripe may send <code>prevented</code> for Visa transactions covered by RDR when the merchant is enrolled through a third party.</p>\n<p>Shopify doesn’t enroll merchants into dispute prevention services.

If the latter, consider reviewing your US market pricing to account for these changes.<br>\n* Review the US shipping zone to ensure your shipping rate set up reflects DDP carriers and collects enough from buyers to fulfill your shipping strategy<br>\n* If you work with an external fulfillment partner in Canada, verify your fulfillment provider can generate Canada Post DDP labels. If they cannot, then consider purchasing labels on Shopify.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't make these changes, your Canada Post labels to the U.S. will be blocked starting August 28, 2025. Consider commercial carriers (DHL Express or Purolator via Shopify Shipping) as alternatives if you prefer to maintain DDU shipping.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about shipping with Canada Post to the US, please visit the <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/fulfillment/fulfilling-orders/shipping-labels/shipping-carriers/canada-post#usa-shipping\">Shopify Help Center</a>.</p>\n\n      "

This is required for dynamic bundles that need to itemize individual components while preserving bundle logic.</p>\n\n<p>Together, these updates give app developers the tools to build high-quality, omnichannel bundling experiences — with clean cart behavior, accurate inventory tracking, and better in-store workflows.</p>\n\n      "

      "description": "\n        <p>We’re introducing an improvement to selling in Shopify POS. Staff can now build an order where items can be carried out in-store and shipped directly to a customer’s address. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Whats New</strong><br>\n* Each item in the cart can have its own delivery method, eliminating the need to check out separate carts for different delivery options. This means your staff can handle mixed orders - shipping some items while allowing customers to take home others right away. <br>\n* The ship and carry out feature lets you sell both in-stock and out-of-stock items together, giving customers more choices and allowing you to utilize inventory across your retail network. <br>\n* By consolidating items into one cart, bundle pricing and discounts apply across all purchased items, reducing overhead on staff and improving the customers purchasing experience. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How Ship and Carryout Works</strong><br>\n* <strong>Split quantity limitations:</strong> Items of the same product variant cannot be split across line items. If a variant appears both in a bundle and as a separate line item, they will need to share the same delivery method. <br>\n* <strong>Tax engine compatibility:</strong> Ship and carry out is only supported if you are using Avalara 2.0, Vertex, or Registration-based taxes (excluding stores based in the United States, European Union, and United Kingdom) tax engines. We will be expanding support to include ShopifyTax. Be sure to verify your settings to take advantage of this feature.<br><br>\n* <strong>Regional shipping restrictions: *<em>All items in a single delivery cart must be from the same tax region, as configured in your Shopify Admin. However, within the EU, you can ship across countries since it operates under a unified tax engine. <br>\n* *</em>Email templates</strong>: Default email templates for Order confirmation, Order invoice, Order Edited, POS and Mobile Receipt, and New Order Notification will be automatically updated to show items shipped and items carried out. Custom email templates will need to be manually updated. </p>\n\n<p>Ship and carry out provides a more flexible shopping experience for your customers while simplifying the checkout process for your staff. Learn about ship and carry out in the <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/sell-in-person/shopify-pos/order-management/ship-and-carry-out\">Help Center</a>. </p>\n\n      "

      "description": "\n        <p>Flow now has better tools for searching and troubleshooting what happened when a workflow ran. </p>\n\n<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n\n<p>Previously, when an action was successful, it might have been difficult to tell what the action did in your shop. For example, when updating a metafield value, what metafield value was set? With these improvements, you will now be able to see the data that was provided to the action, enabling you to better understand what happened.</p>\n\n<p>In this example, by clicking “Step data”, you can see that the “Add order tag” action received as input an order id and a “guitar2” tag:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://screenshot.click/30-24-cwny5-4yr48.png\" alt=\"Example data showing a tag value\"></p>\n\n<p>Since tag actions do not return data, the output is null. </p>\n\n<p>The step data for triggers may be especially useful to check to understand data in your workflow. Triggers contain the data  that Flow receives  from the event (typically an ID) and the data that Flow queries to run the workflow as you designed:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://screenshot.click/30-32-h8rhx-cjsg2.png\" alt=\"Example showing trigger data\"></p>\n\n<h2>Searching</h2>\n\n<p>Building on prior improvements for searching workflow runs, you can now search any of the step data as part of Flow’s run search. To begin a search in the Flow app, go to a list of workflow runs and choose “Add filter” and then “Includes text”. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://screenshot.click/30-14-s6p63-vgetm.png\" alt=\"Example showing where to find the new filter\"></p>\n\n<p>You can search any of the fields available as “step data”  in the run details. Please note that you can only search the text and you must omit any punctuation. For example, to search for an order ID, search “124443” and not “gid://shopify/Order/124443”.</p>\n\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n\n<p>For more information visit our help center pages about <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/manual/shopify-flow/monitor\">finding and monitoring workflows</a>.

This update is designed to enhance how permissions are assigned and managed, making user management more efficient and secure as your business grows.</p>\n\n<p>New enhancements include:<br>\n* Simplified Role Assignments: Set up roles with specific permissions and assign them to multiple users at once. This change is aimed at reducing the time and effort involved in user onboarding and ongoing management.<br>\n* Enhanced Flexibility: Easily assign multiple roles to a single user, allowing for greater adaptability to meet diverse business needs and simplify the auditing process.<br>\n* Efficient Onboarding with Groups (Shopify Plus only): Utilize Groups to simultaneously assign roles and store access across your staff, improving onboarding and management of large teams.</p>\n\n<p>Your existing users will keep their access and be marked with a 'Legacy access\" badge. If your organization had used roles in the past, those roles have now been converted into user groups under the same names and marked with a 'Legacy Access' badge. <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/staff-accounts/staff-roles/managing-staff-roles#create-a-role\">Create and assign roles</a> to users or groups to remove the badge and ensure smooth transition to the new model. </p>\n\n<p><strong>As the organization administrator or owner, we recommend you update permissions for all users by May 1, 2025.</strong> After this date, users and groups with legacy access will be automatically migrated to have one role per store, potentially creating many auto-generated roles.

Previously, discounts created by Discount Functions were available to be leveraged on the Online store, and now they can be used on POS as well.  Discount functions are most frequently used by third party apps on the Shopify App Store to offer extended functionality on top of Shopify’s native platform. This results in more omnichannel capabilities when it comes to discount management in Shopify.</p>\n\n<h3>Use cases:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Trigger discounts based on <a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/api/functions/reference/order-discounts/graphql/input\">attributes</a> not available to be used natively, such as custom metafields or the customer’s lifetime value</li>\n<li>Create more advanced criteria for discounts to be eligible, such as “Buy A, B and (C or D), get E for free”</li>\n<li>Link discounts to other functionalities (loyalty, gift registry, membership)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Important information:</h2>\n\n<h3>Limitations:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Discounts created by Discount Functions are automatically eligible on different sales channels, including Online Store and POS.

Discounts created through native functionality or discount functions will behave the same on POS</li>\n<li>Discount Functions can be configured to apply automatically, or can be triggered by entering a discount code.</li>\n<li>Discount Functions can be set as smart grid tiles, similar to native discount codes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Technical:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The following API’s are relevant to this functionality:\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/api/functions\">Shopify Functions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/api/functions/reference/order-discounts\">Order Discount Function API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/api/functions/reference/product-discounts\">Product Discount Function API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/api/functions/reference/shipping-discounts\">Shipping Discount Function API</a></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>There are no functional changes to APIs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Reporting:<br>\n- Discounts created through Discount Functions are of the same type as native discount (automatic / code, product/order/shipping).

Return rules are structured policies for returns that can now be used whether the return happens in store or is a self serve return online.</p>\n\n<p>Return rules are a great way to ensure consistency and accuracy when processing returns. Which in turn helps reduce demand on staff to make decisions and builds trust between customers and your brand. </p>\n\n<p>Return rules are configured in the Shopify Admin. Once configured, saved policies determine a products' eligibility once the item is added to the return. When products are ineligible, POS will surface additional context to staff on why it cannot be returned. Return window and Final Sale are the return rules that will be applicable to POS, and evaluated on each item in an order.</p>\n\n<p>If a product is ineligible for a return and staff determine the product should be returned anyway, managers with associated permissions can override the return policy to complete the return or exchange. </p>\n\n<p>Learn more about new return rules in POS in the <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/sell-in-person/shopify-pos/order-management/return-rules\">Shopify Help Center</a>.</p>\n\n      "

This prevented staff from updating customer details or adjusting product items and quantities. </p>\n\n<p>With this update, the Ship to customer workflow is now fully integrated with the cart. This means, when products are added to the cart and shipping is chosen as the fulfillment method, staff are required to add customer information, customer shipping address, and shipping method selection. Adding a customer to a Ship to customer order has now moved to the top of the cart, rather than accessing a Smart grid tile. </p>\n\n<p>When adding an existing customer with addresses on file, staff can select the customers preferred address from the available list by tapping “Add Shipping Address”. New customers' addresses are automatically filled in when all address information is added to their customer profile. If staff have the Ship to customer permission, but do not have permission to Add customers or Manage customers permissions, they will still be able to add a customer when checking out a shipping order. This is the only instance where add and manage customer permissions will be overridden. </p>\n\n<p>When selecting the shipping method, the best shipping rate is automatically selected based on the cart’s content. If staff wish to change this rate or apply a custom rate, they can do so by tapping the ‘Shipping Rate’ button. Changes to the cart's contents might invalidate the selected rate unless a custom rate was provided. Staff will be notified with a dialog prompt about changes to the selected rate if the price of the cheapest available rate is higher than the previously selected. </p>\n\n<p>If staff proceed to checkout with incomplete customer information, a validation error screen will display listing the missing information required for checkout. </p>\n\n<p>Learn more about ship to customer in the <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/sell-in-person/shopify-pos/order-management/add-shipping\">Help center</a>. </p>\n\n      "

      "description": "\n        <h2>Shipping line weights</h2>\n\n<p>The shipping line(s) shown in the financial summary card on the order details page has always included the total shipping line weight, but this value was potentially incorrect for the following reasons:<br>\n* The total shipping weight would be increased if additional items were added to the order, but it did not decrease when items were removed from an order<br>\n* For orders with multiple shipping lines, the same shipping weight value was repeated on each shipping line<br>\n* The shipping weight consists of the total weight of all items + the weight of packaging, but the package weight was based on the store’s default package weight, which may not match the actual package that was selected during checkout when calculating the shipping rates<br>\n* If the store’s default package weight is changed, this change also impacted the total shipping line weight of all existing orders</p>\n\n<p>We have made changes so that total weight is updated when items are removed from the order, and also now show the total item weight separately from the default package weight.</p>\n\n<h2>Tax-inclusive pricing</h2>\n\n<p>The financial summary shown on the orders details page has historically misrepresented some of the financial values for orders with tax-inclusive pricing. On these orders, the subtotal and shipping values have always included taxes, despite the fact that those values were also represented again on the taxes row. This meant that the sum of all values in the financial summary exceeded the actual total value of the order.</p>\n\n<p>We had made the decision to modify this behavior to provide an accurate financial summary of the order, by removing taxes from the subtotal and shipping values shown in the card, resulting in a behavior consistent with orders without tax-inclusive pricing. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately this led to some unexpected confusion on tax-inclusive orders and proportional shipping taxes amplified the issue. With tax-inclusivity enabled, the shipping taxes are actually deducted from the shipping price that was shown/charged to the buyer, as opposed to charging additional taxes on top of the price shown/charged to the buyer. This meant that the pre-tax value of the shipping fee was less than some merchants expected. See below for a detailed example.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The card has been reverted to include taxes in the subtotal of line items and taxes in shipping costs as applicable.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Example order values:<br>\nOrder subtotal, pre-taxes: 161.41<br>\nDiscounts: -1.04<br>\nLine item taxes: 5.86<br>\nOrder subtotal, taxes included: 167.27<br>\nShipping fees, pre-taxes: 24.07<br>\nShipping fees, taxes included: 24.95<br>\nShipping taxes (proportional): 0.88<br>\nTotal: 191.18</p>\n\n<p>The shop shipping rates are configured as tax-inclusive, which means taxes are computed and removed from the shipping line base price.</p>\n\n<p>With the new changes, the order financial card would display the following:</p>\n\n<p>Subtotal: 161.41<br>\nDiscounts: -1.04<br>\nShipping: 24.07<br>\nTaxes (10%): 6.74<br>\nTotal: 191.18</p>\n\n<p><strong>The order financial card has been reverted to the previous display.</strong><br>\nSubtotal: 167.27<br>\nDiscounts: -1.04<br>\nShipping: 24.95<br>\nTaxes (10% included): 6.74<br>\nTotal: 191.18</p>\n\n      "

With this update we see merchants achieving up to 50% lower cost of acquisition on their paid ads.  </p>\n\n<p>Shopify Audiences is a powerful tool that leverages constantly improving algorithms to optimize your ad performance. Shopify has access to millions of purchase intent signals, from buyer awareness all the way through to actual purchase. Shopify Audiences’ algorithms analyze this breadth of data and predict the buyers who are most likely to purchase from your specific brand based on behavioral patterns, making it possible to target and convert buyers at a lower cost. </p>\n\n<h3>More on the algorithms</h3>\n\n<p>The Shopify Audiences data science team launches multiple algorithms regularly in search of the model that will maximize your conversion and minimize your cost to purchase ad impressions (CPM).</p>\n\n<p>The Shopify Audiences team discerns which models best optimize advertising performance through experimentation. Custom audience lists are generated using several algorithms. Shopify tracks which customers convert, which is then mapped back to which algorithm placed that customer in the audience list. The “winning” algorithms are the ones whose submitted set of customers included the highest proportion of conversions.</p>\n\n<p>Our newest algorithms as of July 2023 “won” against all preceding algorithms that have been used for Shopify Audiences. A step change in performance has been hit, and we’re excited for you to try <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-audiences?utm_source=changelog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=editions-summer2023&amp;utm_content=try-audiences-cta\">Shopify Audiences v2.0</a>! </p>\n\n      "

The new URL format can be seen in action on the demo store <a href=\"https://www.snowdevil.ca\">www.snowdevil.ca</a>. The old <code>cdn.shopify.com/…</code> URL format will continue to work indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p>The new format will be returned by liquid tags and will be present in Shopify-rendered storefront HTML, but the old format will continue to be used in all API responses. This new asset delivery approach is not used on headless shops, which will continue to use <code>cdn.shopify.com/…</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The domain used in the new URL format is dependent on the request context: it may be the store’s permanent <code>myshopify.com</code> domain or a custom domain depending on which one a buyer visits. Custom code that depends on the old URL format may need to be updated to support both formats.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, new images associated with products now use the <code>/files</code> path format rather than the previous <code>/products</code>. Previously uploaded product images will continue to use the <code>/products</code> path.</p>\n\n<p>These changes are being made to provide a variety of benefits: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Improved page load times on storefronts to provide a better buyer experience and improve conversion rate. Improvements to page load speed are potentially on the order of hundreds of milliseconds.</li>\n<li>Improved security: because we don't need to allow for cross-origin assets from our CDN, we can use more restrictive content security policies (CSP) and cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policies.</li>\n<li>Less Shopify branding on merchant domains.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Action Required:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li> Ensure that any custom code you may have is free from hard-coded assumptions on the old URL format</li>\n</ul>\n\n      "

It lets merchants make code-free customizations to their checkout using the new checkout editor and public apps, while also giving them the flexibility to develop custom apps for more bespoke customizations. </p>\n\n<p>Checkout extensibility replaces checkout.liquid. As a result, checkout.liquid customizations will no longer work for in-checkout pages starting August 13, 2024. Shops that currently use checkout.liquid to customize their in-checkout pages need to upgrade their customizations to checkout extensibility before this date. Checkouts that aren’t upgraded on time will be automatically upgraded to an un-customized, out-of-the-box Shopify Checkout.</p>\n\n<p>Shopify Plus merchants can continue customizing their post-checkout pages, which includes the Thank You and Order Status Page, with checkout.liquid. However, we’ll eventually support customization on these pages with checkout extensibility as well. </p>\n\n<p>Learn more in the <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/extend/checkout-migration\">Shopify help center</a> or <a href=\"https://admin.shopify.com/settings/checkout\">start your upgrade</a>.</p>\n\n      "

We’ve also made a few minor content and visual changes to inventory indicators so that staff can quickly and easily see which products are sold out and might be available elsewhere. Inventory states can reduce unintended overselling, inform selling decisions in store and provide insight into where your inventory is physically and if it can be sold. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the Incoming state?</strong><br>\nThe Incoming state is inventory that is in transit on a transfer or partially received. If you have entered the expected arrival date and the tracking number in Admin, this will also display in POS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the Committed state?</strong><br>\nThe Committed state is inventory that has been sold or paid for but has not yet been fulfilled. Having visibility into what stock is available for sale and how much is committed to orders can help keep your inventory accurate. </p>\n\n<p>To see committed state for a product in Shopify admin, create an order in Shopify admin that is paid for but not yet fulfilled.

Here’s what’s new in the upgraded experience:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>New name and new look.</li>\n<li>Access through Shopify admin, login with Shopify credentials.</li>\n<li>Team members require Shopify staff accounts for access.</li>\n<li>All communication through email tied to your Shopify store.</li>\n<li>Creators can discover you through Shopify and apply for partnership.</li>\n<li>Your application page has a new URL. Old link will redirect automatically.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>More details on the changes:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Name and look.</strong> Dovetale as a stand-alone platform is being sunset. All the features that used to be part of the platform are migrated into Shopify and will be known as Shopify Collabs. Former Dovetale will now look similar to the rest of Shopify admin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Shopify login.</strong> You used to have a separate login for Dovetale and as of Aug 16, 2022, you’ll need your Shopify login to access Shopify Collabs. You can access it from the admin, in the left-hand panel, once you install the Shopify Collabs app. </p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Staff accounts.</strong> Dovetale had a team manager where you could add team members to manage your creator partnerships. In Shopify Collabs, you’ll need to issue a staff account for every team member to grant them access. Here’s how to <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/staff-accounts/create-staff-accounts\">invite staff members into Shopify</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Shopify email.</strong> Dovetale used your login email for notifications and information about your account. Shopify Collabs will send all communication through the email tied to your Shopify Store.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Creator discovery.</strong> The fun part! With Dovetale, you needed to manually share your application page to get creators to apply to you. Shopify Collabs has a <a href=\"http://shopify.com/collabs/find-brands\">separate platform for creators</a> where they can discover brands and apply for partnership. If you would like to opt out of this feature and not be listed on the discovery platform for creators, <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/support/login\">contact Shopify support</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. New page link.</strong> Your application page for creators will move from dovetale.com/community/ to join.collabs.shopify.com/community/. The new URL will be applied to your page automatically and all the old links you have posted will redirect to the new page. No action is required on your part.</p>\n\n      "

You can use the <a href=\"https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/filters#map\">map</a> filter to create an array of values from another array. </p>\n\n<p>Assign<br>\nAssign allows you to do complex math and string manipulations to a single field or list. It also allows you to use the output of one set of tags in another tag. For example, you can generate a random number between 1 and 10 like this:</p>\n\n<p><code><br>\n{% assign min = 1 %}<br>\n{% assign max = 10 %}<br>\n{% assign diff = max | minus: min %}<br>\n{% assign theRandomNumber = \"now\" | date: \"%N\" | modulo: diff | plus: min %}<br>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Capture<br>\nCapture allows you to write complex logic and strings and then capture the output of a block of liquid to a variable. This means you can write functions for your liquid in one place and then use the variable in much simplified liquid. </p>\n\n<p>```<br>\n{%- capture title -%}<br>\n  {% if product.title contains “XYZ” -%}<br>\n    Upcase title: {{ product.title | upcase }}<br>\n  {%- else -%}<br>\n    Downcase title: {{ product.title | downcase }}<br>\n  {%- endif %}<br>\n{%- endcapture %}</p>\n\n<p>{% comment %}Use title field{% endcomment %}<br>\n{{ title }}<br>\n```</p>\n\n<p>Map<br>\nMap allows you to easily create a list of values from a specific property of the items in a list. You can also combine this with assign to make a variable. For example, this outputs the titles for all the products in a collection, separated by a comma.</p>\n\n<p><code><br>\n{%- assign product_titles = collection.products | map: 'title' -%}<br>\n{{ product_titles | join: ', ' }}<br>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-flow\">Shopify Flow</a> from the Shopify Help Center.</p>\n\n      "

      "description": "\n        <p>Shopify Flow is now available in the Shopify plan and up (including Advanced plan and Shopify Plus plan). </p>\n\n<h3>What is Shopify Flow?</h3>\n\n<p>Shopify Flow is an ecommerce automation solution that lets you build workflows to automate tasks, campaigns, and processes within your store. It also lets you connect your existing apps and tools together, for even more workflow possibilities. Flow automations give you the power to build the custom solutions that your business needs to scale. Check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSpHWGh6zKY\">this video</a> for a quick Flow overview.  </p>\n\n<h3>What are some workflow automation examples?</h3>\n\n<p>Flow automations can take a host of different forms like tagging customers for segmentation and marketing, hiding products and initiating reorder emails for low or out of stock items, kicking off winback and post-purchase SMS/email campaigns, or tracking and halting high-risk orders. With each workflow, the goal is the same: to let you build the <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/ecommerce-automation-software-shopify-flow\">custom workflow</a> that your business needs.</p>\n\n<h3>How can I start using Flow?</h3>\n\n<p>Go to Flow’s <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/flow\">app store listing</a>, click “Add app” and follow the installation instructions to install. </p>\n\n<h3>Where can I get help?</h3>\n\n<p>Learn more about how the Flow works in the <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-flow\">Shopify Help Center</a>.</p>\n\n      "

New options for shipping taxes will let merchants selling in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, or Maryland choose whether or not to tax shipping. We've added this because you've let us know you need more flexibility on whether or not you charge taxes on your shipping, based on your business. </p>\n\n<p>The default option will be automatic, which means Shopify will intelligently choose whether or not to tax your shipping based on your shop settings. The new \"on\" or \"off\" functions will allow you more fine-grained control over your tax settings.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/manual/taxes/us/us-tax-setup\">shipping tax options</a> from the Shopify Help Center.</p>\n\n      "
