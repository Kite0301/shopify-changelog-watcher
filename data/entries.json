Code changes appear on your POS test device instantly without flickering. This update also supports reloading entire navigation screens, so you no longer need to exit and re-enter a screen to see your changes.  </li>\n<li><strong>POS dev console:</strong> When you scan your deeplink, you are immediately directed to the POS dev console where you view your app and extension information. The console offers easy access to targets and configurations, centralizing everything you need to efficiently build your extension.  </li>\n<li><strong>Quick target previews:</strong> With the new &quot;Preview&quot; feature in the dev console, you can instantly jump to the correct screen in the POS app where your extension is rendered.  </li>\n<li><strong>Build error reporting:</strong> If your extension code triggers an error, you’ll now see an error UI directly on the POS device. Tapping the broken component opens the dev console with information about the extension and the error.  </li>\n<li><strong>App persistence:</strong> You can configure your extension to automatically reconnect after a POS restart, removing the need to deep link repeatedly.  </li>\n<li><strong>In-app reset:</strong> You can remove your extension without restarting the POS or your dev server, making it easy to test new deep links quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ready to get started?

Grouping objects can slow down operations and increase failure rates, especially with large datasets.</p>\n<h3>Bulk Mutations (<code>bulkOperationRunMutation</code>)</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/2026-01/mutations/bulkoperationrunmutation#arguments-groupObjects\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\"><code>groupObjects</code></a> argument is now deprecated. It does not affect the order of output files because mutation outputs do not have parent objects.</p>\n<h2>What You Need to Do</h2>\n<h3>If You're Running Bulk Queries</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>To maintain grouped output</strong>: Set <code>groupObjects: true</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-graphql\">mutation {\n  bulkOperationRunQuery(\n    query: &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    {\n      products {\n        edges {\n          node {\n            id\n            title\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    groupObjects: true  // Add this to maintain grouped output\n  ) {\n    bulkOperation {\n      id\n      status\n    }\n    userErrors {\n      field\n      message\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>If You're Running Bulk Mutations</h3>\n<p>Remove the <code>groupObjects</code> argument from your queries. This will not impact the output files.</p>\n<h2>Why We Made This Change</h2>\n<p>Most applications do not require grouped output and the associated overhead negatively impacts performance. These changes deliver faster, more predictable results that are easier to process at scale. Enable <code>groupObjects</code> only if your application specifically depends on the grouped output format. As this was the default behavior previously, you can verify on any version after <code>2025-07</code> by setting <code>groupObjects</code> to <code>false</code> and testing your application.</p>\n<p>For optimal performance, omit <code>groupObjects</code> on or after <code>2026-01</code>, and disable this option if you are on <code>2025-07</code> or <code>2025-10</code>.</p>\n<h2>Learn More</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/api/usage/bulk-operations/queries\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">Bulk Operations Queries Guide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/api/usage/bulk-operations/imports\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">Bulk Operations Imports Guide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/api/usage/bulk-operations/queries#step-3-retrieve-data\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"body-link\">Working with JSONL Output</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div> "

When on, duty calculations are calculated Ad Valorem based on the Country Code of Origin of your products. This calculation scheme is appropriate if you ship with a postal carrier, like Canada Post. </p>\n\n<p>This new setting applies to all international checkouts with United States as the destination, regardless of available shipping options.</p>\n\n<p>To toggle the feature, visit your admin’s duty settings and click the box next to “Use postal duty rates into the United States”. </p>\n\n<p>For more information on Shopify Duties and Import Taxes, please see the help center.</p>\n\n      "
